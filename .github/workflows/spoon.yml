# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Only run this if we're on the official repo. This prevents forks from getting super confusing with commits. If you want to host you own Spoon repository, consider re-enabling this, but for your repo.
