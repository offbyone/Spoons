;;; emacs-anywhere.el --- Edit text from anywhere in Emacs -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: randall
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1"))
;; Keywords: convenience
;; URL: https://github.com/randall/emacs-anywhere

;;; Commentary:

;; Edit text from any macOS application in Emacs via Hammerspoon.
;;
;; This file is bundled with EmacsAnywhere.spoon and loaded automatically.
;; No Emacs configuration needed beyond (server-start).
;;
;; To customize, set variables in your Emacs config before triggering:
;;   (setq emacs-anywhere-hs-path "/usr/local/bin/hs")
;;   (setq emacs-anywhere-frame-parameters '((width . 100) (height . 30)))
;;   (setq emacs-anywhere-major-mode #'markdown-mode)
;;
;; Use `emacs-anywhere-mode-hook' for further buffer customization:
;;   (add-hook 'emacs-anywhere-mode-hook #'flyspell-mode)
